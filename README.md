# Funkin' GitHub Launcher

**Funkin' GitHub Launcher** is an internal tool for the Funkin' GitHub Crew that makes testing pull requests easier, no more typing out complicated git commands!

### Why is this internal tool public?

Because I love open source! Sharing is caring, and who knows, maybe others will find some code useful too.

## Features

Quickly test pull requests from the Funkin' GitHub repositories

Automatically installs required dependencies: Haxe, Git, and even build tools
